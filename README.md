This Python script scrapes top news headlines from a public news website using the `requests` library to fetch HTML content and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it. 
It extracts text from `<h2>` and `<title>` tags, compiles the headlines, and saves them to a file named `headlines.txt`. 
The script checks for a successful response before parsing and handles missing titles gracefully. 
Itâ€™s a simple example of web scraping and automating data collection from publicly accessible websites for analysis or monitoring.
